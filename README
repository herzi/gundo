Gtk Undo: Multilevel undo/redo for Gtk
Copyright (C) 1999  Nat Pryce


Introduction
------------

Gtk Undo is a Gtk object that manages multilevel undo/redo for an application.
The object stores a sequence of actions and provides methods for undoing or
redoing those actions. It fires signals to inform the application when it is
or is not possible to undo or redo any actions. Utility functions are provided
that react to those signals to keep user interface components in sync with the
undo sequence.

This is version 0.1. The latest version can be found at:
