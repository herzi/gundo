    A GundoSequence is a Gtk object that manages a sequence of actions that
    can be undone and redone.  The structure is opaque; its members should 
    be accessed only by the functions provided by the Gundo library.
    <p>
    GundoSequence objects provide the following signals:
    <dd>
      <dt>"can_undo"</dt>
      <dd>Fired when the undo sequence transitions from a state where it
          cannot undo actions to one where it can.</dd>
      <dt>"can_redo"</dt>
      <dd>Fired when the undo sequence transitions from a state where it
          cannot redo actions to one where it can.</dd>
    </dd>
